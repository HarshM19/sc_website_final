            Event Description :On February 22nd, 2023, the Student's Club in collaboration with SoRT VESIT organized a blood
            donation drive called "Drops of Hope". The drive took place in the Drawing hall of VESIT and was open to
            all VES students. In addition to the blood donation drive, Thalassemia Test and Eye check-up were also
            organized. The drive ran from 10:30 am to 4 pm and saw 226 students register for blood donation. Out of
            these, 118 students were eligible to donate blood. Refreshments such as Glucon-d, biscuits, and
            bananas were provided to those who donated blood. A team of 8-10 doctors was responsible for the
            blood collection drive, and the collected blood was sent to JJ Blood Bank. To raise awareness about the
            drive, the SoRT Aesthetics team decorated the college entrance, and a photo booth was set up. Thanks
            to everyone's willing participation and cooperation, the blood donation drive was a success and helped
            save numerous lives.
