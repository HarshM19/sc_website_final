            While preparing, Faculty members taught all the volunteers to assemble the components of solar kits provided to the college
            Main objective of this visit was to provide solar charging lamps to the children and to make them understand how the lamp works and also to spread awareness about personal hygiene and social evils of bad touch.
            Providing and teaching the workings of solar lamps was the easiest task. Difficult task was to teach students about these social evils. We came with an idea of explaining them about these social evils with the help of a skit.
            Responsibility of preparation of skit was given to the members of SORT council.
            SORT members prepared two skits ,one for personal hygiene and one for Good and bad touch.
            <br>
            The exciting day of this event started early at 6:15a.m. when everyone assembled at college. Before departure we all had morning tea. We departed exactly at 6:45a.m. after loading all our boxes of solar lamps and food. We also had a auspicious prayer before starting our journey.
            We had our breakfast in the bus which we had packed from college canteen. Bus journey was very fun and exciting.
            We reached the school around 9:30a.m. Teachers of the ashram school met our faculty members and gave us a room to keep all our boxes and bags.
            We got to work immidiately after getting settled in we distributed the solar kit to our volunteers and asked them to go in their respective classrooms.
            Dr.Prashant Kanade briefed all the students on why there is a need for solar panels and how it saves our environment.
            After explaining all the students about solar panels we had our lunch break. Meal was prepared by the school staff which was very delicious.
            Lunch break ended at 1:00p.m.
            <br>
            All the sort members went on to perform their skits within 15mins and started performing skits on personal hygiene.
            For the skit of good and bad touch school teachers divided the classrooms in groups of girls and boys.
            Girl volunteers went on to perform their skit with girls and boys volunteers performed their skit in room with boys.
            The skit ended in 15mins and then there was interactive session with all the students.
