            VESIT Students’ Club (under AICTE Spice scheme) in collaboration with SoRT VESIT conducted an event Swayam Jyoti - A Village Visit, to Government Ashram School, Gargaon, Ta. Wada, District Palghar, Maharashtra. The visit was conducted on 14 July, 2023, Friday.
            
            The event started at 6:30 am in the morning with 12 students and 4 faculties assembling at the VESIT College Campus. On taking aboard all of the materials required for the journey, they set out in a 40 seater Bus. The remaining 13 students and 2 faculties were picked up from Thane near Majhiwada Junction. Arrangement for breakfast was done from college which was packed and served to the students en route. After approximately three hours of journey, everyone reached the school by 10:00 am. The faculty and students of VESIT were felicitated with roses by the faculty of the school. Banners and posters were put up on their appropriate positions.
            
            The first session of the visit included a presentation on Solar Energy along with a demonstration of installing and assembling solar lamps. This session aimed at educating the children about the harms of non renewable energy, its carbon footprint and the benefits of Solar Energy. This was followed by showcasing the model and the components of the solar lamp as well as a live assembly of it. 50 lamps were taken to the school which were later distributed to the students of class 10th - 12th.
            
            After the first session a lunch break was taken for an hour where the students and faculties were served freshly made lunch.
            The second session commenced after lunch which consisted of two workshops, first on hygiene and the second on safe & unsafe touch. A skit was conducted on hygiene where the students were introduced about the disadvantages of not maintaining personal hygiene and a narrative story based on safe and unsafe touch. They were also explained about the lesson of touching another person without consent. Period Hygiene was covered for girls while boys were educated on personal hygiene and the important role it plays in their future. At the end of the second session, the speakers held an informal dialogue with the children, answering their questions as well as motivating them on topics relating to studies and career. They were even explained about  the various fields they can opt in the future for conserving the environment and being a change in the society.
            
            After the completion of both the sessions the students and faculties departed from the village. 
            They reached Majiwada Junction around 8:30 pm. The bus also dropped off the remaining students near the college campus around 9:30 pm.
